## House Prices - à la Kaggle

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.  
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.  

  
File descriptions  
  
    train.csv - the training set  
    test.csv - the test set  
    data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here  
    sample_submission.csv - a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms  
  
Data fields  
  
Here's a brief version of what you'll find in the data description file.

2) ANALYSIS 2: Build the most predictive model for sales prices of homes in all of Ames Iowa.  This includes all neighborhoods.  Your group is limited to only the techniques we have learned in 6371 (no random forests or other methods we have not yet covered.)  Specifically, you should produce 4 models: one from forward selection, one from backwards elimination, one from stepwise selection and one that you build custom.  The custom model could be one of the three preceding models or one that you build by adding or subtracting variables at your will.  Generate an adjusted R2, CV Press and Kaggle Score for each of these models and clearly describe which model you feel is the best in terms of being able to predict future sale prices of homes in Ames, Iowa.  In your paper, please include a table similar to the one below.  The group with the lowest public Kaggle score will receive an extra 2 bonus points on the final exam!    
Hint: for this analysis, start with the included SAS code written by Bivin and you may want to revisit the YouTube video linked above.  
Quick note on Kaggle completion:  `We only have one course under our belts so far (almost), but you can compete in this competition with the tools you have now (Top 40th percentile or less)!   And, after your next course (6372) you will really be able to do well top 25th percentile (or less)!  With these skills and the skills you pick up in Data Mining and Quantifying the World, you will be able to compete with anyone!

NOTE 1: ALL ANALYSIS MUST BE DONE IN SAS and all code must be placed in the appendix.  Part of the grading process will be to run the code and verify the Kaggle score for each group.    
  
Note 2: An extra 2 points on the final exam will be awarded to the team with the model with the lowest (best) Kaggle Score.  In the unlikely event of a tie we will split these points.    
  
  
  
Deliverables:  
Your group is to turn in a paper that is no more that 7 pages long (without the appendix). Please put your code in the appendix, but any graphs and tables in the body of the paper.
