###Analysis Question 2  

***  

#### __Statement of Problem__  

Estimating market value of a home for sale has significant implications for all parties involved in the transaction : seller, buyer, agents, mortgage providers and even local taxing authorities. Getting it right can improve local economies. Inefficiencies associated to historical methods of value assessments create hesitation on the part of buyers and lenders, and potential loss of revenue for sellers and agents. Developing a model that considers all available factors and provides a transparent valuation that can be shared among all parties in the transaction can enable the participants to proceed with increased confidence, thus increasing the velocity of the local real estate market.  
That is the purpose of this evaluation : use all available contributing factors for the residnetial real estate market in Ames, Iowa and create a predicitve model to better estimate market valuation for future properties to be proposed for sale.  
  
***  

#### __Data Available & Utilized__  

For this evaluation, there are seventy-nine explanatory variables available for exploitation, based on residential sales in the years 2006 trough 2010, comprising approximately 1500 sales. The explanatory variables include traditional expected characteristics, such as : neighborhood, square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc. and also several factors that are perhaps considered secondary or tertiary, but are included in the modeling to increase predictive capability. Some of these additional factors include : heating type, number of fireplaces, qualitative assessment of the kitchen condition.  
  
***  
  
#### __Model Construction__  

In order to build the model, the following steps are taken :  
* read in the raw training data set provided,  
* basic cleaning of the data, including removing significant outliers (for this purpose, more than 5 std deviations from mean)  
* imputing values for features where none was provided (for this purpose, setting to mean value for numeric features, and creating a new factor level "None" for categorical features),  
 * plot and visually examine each feature in relation to log(SalePrice) ...  
+ this provides a basis for removing some features from consideration based on inspection  
  	+ some features may have 1400 / 1460 within same cateegory, thus not providing varaibility worthwhile including in a model  
  	+ some numerical features are sparsely populated, and the the few values visually exhibit zero slope in relation to log(SalePrice)  
  	+ a new feature was created "saledate" from the "year sold" and "month sold" features. Upon visual examination, there was no obvious trend in the time series view for  log(SalePrice)s, so this was eventually discarded   
  	+ this visual examination then results in eliminating approximately 25 of the features from consideration in the model.  
  	+ (All of the plots are available for review at the referenced GitHub site : "homes_train_plots.pdf")

***  

#### __Models Considered__  

In all cases, the basic data set consists of 52 predictor variables and the dependent output variable log(SalePrice)

Four different models are built :  
	*		Stepwise  - modeled in SAS proc glmselect  
	*		Forward   - modeled in SAS proc glmselect  
	*		Backward  - modeled in SAS proc glmselect  
	*		CUSTOM 	-   model based on the above three models ... just average the resutls of these models and see if this improves the Kaggle score.  
  
  ***  
  
#### __Residuals Evaluation__	   
* the following plots show the distribution of residuals and the predicted vs. the actual sale price (log scale) for the custom model. From these plots, we consider that the basic assumptions of normality in the residuals is achieved, and that the visual aspect of the fitted model aligns well with the dependent variable to be modeled. For brevity's sake, the only plots shown here are for the stepwise selction model. The residuals plots for the other models assessed were similar in nature.

#### __Influential point analysis (Cook’s D and Leverage)__  

Test for assumptions:

* Normality: From QQ plot, scatter and histogram, normality is generally respected. The residuals histogram and QQ plot show a slight tendency towards left skewness. With next modeling attempts, this is an area for potential improvement. 

* Linearity: The predicted vs. actual model shows a very good fit, and strong linear response characteristics. In addition, the residuals plot do not show any obvious tendency towards non-linearity or increasing / decreasing variance across the range of values evaluated. The assumption of linearity appears respected for this model.

* Equal variance: The residuals plot and the studentized residuals plots both show respect within reasonable bounds that equal variances here are acceptable.

* Cook's D and the Leverage Plots show a few influential points. The leverage plot, in particular, shows 2 points with relatively high leverage; however in this model, with 1400+ additional data points, the influence of these 2 points is not substantial.

#### __Comparing Competing Models__  
		

 Model           | Adj R²      |  CV Press  | Kaggle Score  
---------------- | ------------|------------|--------------
Forward          |   0.91      |   22.10    |  0.189  
Backward         |   0.92      |   23.17    |  0.226  
Stepwise         |   0.91      |   22.13    |  0.133 
Custom           |   0.90      |            |  0.225

### __Conclusion:__   

* For this effort, the 4 models each provide good predictive capability for estimating market valuation of residential real estate to be proposed for offering in the Ames, Iowa market.  
* The stepwise model outperformed the other selection methods for the features chosen in this case. In addition, the stepwise selection also resulted in the least number of features (14) in comparison, also providing a simpler model. The table above shows the characteristics relative to model fit, along with the Kaggle scores when the model is applied to the test case data set. Clearly, the stepwise model selection is the preferred model among those evaluated.
  
  
The retained features in the final model include :  

 Feature        | Feature      | Feature    |  Feature     | Feature    
----------------|--------------|------------|--------------|-------------  
 bsmtfinsf1     | centralair   | fireplaces | garagecars   | kitchenqual  
 log(grlivarea) | log(lotarea) | mszoning   | neighborhood | overallcond  
 overallqual    | totalbsmtsf  | yearbuilt  | yearremodadd |
